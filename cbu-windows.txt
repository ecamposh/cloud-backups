​
### Please do the following for the uninstallation (use an user with admin permissions).
​
1) Go to 'services.msc' and stop driveclient service.
​
2) Copy and paste folder DriveClient found on C:\ProgramData\  to a location you can retrieve later if needed.
​
3) Proceed with normal uninstallation through "Control Panel --> Programs and Features".
​
If no Rackspace Cloud Backup program found please do as follows:
​

​
Repository --> http://agentrepo.drivesrvr.com/win64/
​

​
If you are still getting errors in this part follow the next procedure:
​
1. Open a Command Prompt by right clicking on it and "Run As Administrator".
​
2. Query both services, to see the status they are in:
     A. sc query driveclient
     B. sc query upgradercbusvc
       *If one or both of these are not installed, and you can skip that one.
​
3. Stop any services that are running from command prompt.
     A. sc stop driveclient
     B. sc stop upgradercbusvc
       *This will show "STATE : 3 STOP_PENDING". Run the 'sc query' commands (step 2 above) for the appropriate service(s), until "STATE : 1 STOPPED".
​
4. Once the service(s) are stopped, we need to delete them out of the Service Manager
     A. sc delete driveclient
     B. sc delete upgradercbusvc
       *This should show: "[SC] DeleteService SUCCESS"
        
5. Delete the following directories, and all sub directories/files:
            C:\Program Files\DriveClient
                del /S /F "C:\Program Files\DriveClient"
                del /S /F "C:\ProgramData\DriveClient"
​
6. Remove registry keys
     All registry keys are stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rackspace\CloudBackup
​
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
​
4) Delete the following directories:
​
C:\Program Files\DriveClient
C:\ProgramData\DriveClient
​
5) Also delete windows registry keys contained on the path --> Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rackspace\CloudBackup
​
6) Attempt re-installing/re-registering Rackspace Cloud Backup (driveclient) agent.
